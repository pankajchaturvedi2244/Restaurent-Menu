# Restaurent-Menu — Assignment Submission

**Live Application:** [https://restaurent-menu-beta.vercel.app/](https://restaurent-menu-beta.vercel.app/)

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/pankajchaturvedi2244/Restaurent-Menu](https://github.com/pankajchaturvedi2244/Restaurent-Menu)

---

## ⭐ Overview

This project is a **fully dynamic Restaurant Menu Management System** built using **Next.js (App Router)** with a complete backend powered by **Next.js API Routes** and a **PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon**. Categories and dishes are fully stored and served from the database — nothing is hard‑coded.

This README includes all details requested for submission.

## 🧠 My Approach

My goal was to deliver a clean, scalable, and production-ready full-stack application. I:

* Used **Next.js** to combine frontend and backend within one unified framework.
* Implemented **API routes** for categories and dishes using the App Router.
* Used **Neon PostgreSQL** as the live database.
* Managed schema and database access using **Prisma ORM**.
* Focused on UI smoothness, data accuracy, and reliable error handling.
* Ensured the app is **fully dynamic**: all menu data is loaded from the database.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

### **IDE**

* Visual Studio Code

### **AI Tools & Models**

* **GitHub Copilot** — inline code suggestions during UI and backend development.
* **ChatGPT** — debugging, hosting help, and technical clarifications.
* **RooCode** — generated initial versions of some API route boilerplates.

### **Sample Prompts Used**

* "Help me generate a Prisma schema for categories and dishes."
* "Explain why Prisma fails to read environment variables in production."
* "Generate an API route for updating menu items in Next.js App Router."
* "How do I integrate Neon DB with Vercel using Prisma?"

### **AI Helpfulness & Corrections Made**

* Copilot helped reduce boilerplate but sometimes produced outdated patterns (fixed manually).
* RooCode's autogenerated routes required corrections to Prisma field names, schema validations, and error structures.
* ChatGPT helped resolve issues related to migrations and environment variables during deployment.

Overall, AI assistance improved speed, but every output was carefully reviewed and refined.

## ⚙️ Technical Summary

### **Backend**

* Fully dynamic APIs under `/app/api/*`
* CRUD support for categories and dishes
* Prisma ORM for secure and typed DB operations

### **Database (Neon PostgreSQL)**

* Hosted online
* Categories and dishes stored relationally
* Live data used throughout the app

### **Frontend**

* Category-based navigation
* Dynamic rendering of dishes
* Smooth scrolling and mobile-friendly design

## ✔ Edge Cases Handled

### ✔ Email / OTP Handling Note

The application uses **Mailtrap** for email delivery during development/testing.
Because Mailtrap requires an authenticated workspace, **other users will not receive emails or OTPs using my credentials**. They can test the email/OTP flow by:

* Creating their own free Mailtrap account
* Generating SMTP credentials
* Replacing the environment variables in `.env` accordingly

This ensures the email system works safely without exposing my credentials.

I accounted for several real-world scenarios:

* Empty categories or no dishes
* Invalid IDs in API requests
* Missing required fields in POST/PATCH
* Unexpected DB errors
* Network or API failures (fallback UI)
* Loading states for slower connections

---

## 🚧 Edge Cases Identified but Not Fully Implemented

Given more time, I would add:

* **Image upload support via Cloudinary/S3**
* **Role-based admin dashboard**
* **More detailed error modals**
* **Rate limiting for APIs**
* **Automated tests** for API routes and frontend components
* **Stronger validation with Zod** and central request validation
* **Missing dish form validations and additional client-side checks** — currently the dish form lacks full field validation (e.g., price numeric checks, max length for name/description, allowed categories, and image validation). I have identified these gaps and included them here as planned changes.

All these were identified but not completed due to delivery timeline.

## 📌 Closing Note

This assignment demonstrates:

* A real full‑stack architecture
* Production deployment using Vercel + Neon
* Fully dynamic menu data
* Clean coding practices and scalable structure

If any additional information is required, I’m happy to provide it.
